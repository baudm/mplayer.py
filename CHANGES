MPlayer

Additions:
* query(name, timeout=0.25):
  A dedicated method for sending a get_* command and expecting a response.
  timeout is the maximum time that query() will wait for MPlayer's response
  which implies that query() may finish faster than the set timeout.

* introspect():
  The addition of the introspect() class method was inspired by the code here:
  http://code.activestate.com/recipes/542195/. Thanks to Fabien Devaux.

  introspect() is for those who want to programatically interact with MPlayer
  using methods instead of using the basic command() and query() interface.

Changes:
* 'bin' class property has been renamed to 'executable'

* 'args' property now accepts any iterable; non-string data are also
  automatically converted to strings. Be careful though...

* start() -> start(stdout=None, stderr=None):
  Now, stdout and stderr are not PIPEd by default. You can now specify the
  values for stdout/stderr to be passed to subprocess.Popen. Take note though
  that attaching subscribers to stdout/stderr will force a PIPE.

* command(name, timeout=0.1) -> command(name, *args):
  The command method no longer accepts a timeout parameter and no longer
  returns the result of a get_* command. Now, its only purpose is to send
  commands, nothing more. Furthermore, it now accepts an arbitrary number of
  parameters which are first converted to string (if not yet a string), then
  concatenated with the command name.

  For querying MPlayer using get_* commands, use the query method
  (new in 0.4.0) instead.

* stop() -> quit(retcode=0):
  Has been renamed to be consistent with the other MPlayer commands.
  Now, it also accepts an optional parameter to specify MPlayer's return code.

* isalive() -> is_alive()


Deletions:
* poll_output
  A single pymplayer.loop can now be used for all classes (MPlayer, Client,
  Server). pymplayer.loop is actually just asyncore.loop and was made
  available in pymplayer for convenience.

* create_handler, remove_handler, handle_data, and handle_error:
  The MPlayer class no longer needs to be subclassed to be able to integrate
  with other frameworks/event loops. Also, obtaining data from MPlayer is
  no longer done by overriding handle_data and handle_error.

  To use the event loops of other frameworks aside from asyncore, the file
  descriptor and publish() method (callback function) can be used as such:

  m = pymplayer.MPlayer()
  # stdout needs to be PIPEd, otherwise we can't use it
  m.start(stdout=pymplayer.PIPE)

  fd = m.stdout.fileno()
  cb = m.stdout.publish

  gobject.io_add_watch(fd, gobject.IO_IN|gobject.IO_PRI, cb)
  tkinter.createfilehandler(fd, tkinter.READABLE, cb)

  To obtain data from MPlayer asynchronously, see method #3 below.


There are now three ways of obtaining data from MPlayer.

1. via readline() method:

m = pymplayer.MPlayer()
m.start(stdout=pymplayer.PIPE)
line = m.stdout.readline()

This method simply returns whatever is in the pipe buffers.
Although this is convenient, using this method is not recommended because
the MPlayer process may still hang if the pipe buffers get filled up and
just sit there waiting to be read from. If you want to, you can define a
timer for periodically calling readline() just to clear up the buffers.
You can also use this with #3.


2. via query() method:

m = pymplayer.MPlayer()
m.start(stdout=pymplayer.PIPE)
m.command('loadfile', '/path/to/some/file.mkv')
time_length = m.query('get_time_length')
# if successful, time_length should now contain a float object

Using only this method has the same problems as the readline() method above.
I personally use this method with the one described below (#3) since I won't
have to worry about MPlayer hanging.

*** IMPORTANT ***
Upon execution, query() will temporarily suppress the transfer of data to the
subscribers. Upon finishing, data transfer to the subscribers will be enabled
again.


3. via subscribers (asynchronous):

This method is inspired by the Observer design pattern (aka publisher/subscriber)
and is the replacement for handle_data() and handle_error(). Basically,
subscribers are simply callback functions which accept a single parameter--the
data published by whichever publisher (stdout/stderr) the subscribers are
attached to.


Example for typical usage of methods:

"a hypothetical class for a GUI program"

...
def __init__(self):
  super(SomeClass, self).__init__()
  self.pl = playlist_generator()
  self.m = pymplayer.MPlayer()
  # introspect MPlayer executable so that we can just use additional methods
  # instead of using command() or query() directly
  self.m.introspect()
  self.m.stdout.attach(self.check_mplayer_eof)
  self.timer = SomeTimer(timeout=1000, callback=self.update_status)

def __del__(self):
  # not really needed. just here for demo purposes
  self.m.stdout.detach(self.check_mplayer_eof)
  # make sure MPlayer is terminated properly
  self.m.quit()

def load_video(self):
  video = self.pl.next() # get next video
  self.m.loadfile(video) # uses command() internally
  filename = self.m.get_file_name() # uses query() internally
  time_length = self.m.get_time_length() # uses query() internally
  self.statusbar.set_text('Now playing: %s (%d seconds)' % (filename, time_length))

def check_mplayer_eof(self, data):
  if data.startswith('EOF code'):
    self.load_video()

def update_status(self):
  pos = self.m.get_time_pos()
  self.statusbar2.set_text('Current Time: %d' % (pos, ))

def run(self):
  # subscribers were attached to stdout, no need to explicitly set stdout to PIPE
  self.m.start()
  # echo first 5 lines of MPlayer's output
  for i in xrange(5):
    print 'debug: ', self.m.stdout.readline()
...
